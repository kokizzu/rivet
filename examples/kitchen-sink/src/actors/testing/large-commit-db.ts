// Depot sends a commit of at most 320 dirty pages as one message applied in one
// FDB transaction, and anything larger as N shard-aligned staged segments
// followed by a finalize. This actor's job is to put commits on both sides of
// that boundary on demand, so the staged path can be checked for the things
// that only go wrong at scale: pages resolving to the wrong version, a commit
// that half-lands, and what a large commit does to write throughput.
//
// Payloads are deterministic in the row id rather than random, so correctness
// is checkable in SQL over the whole table without reading it back over the
// wire. `integrity_check` alone would not catch a page that resolves to a
// stale-but-valid version, which is the failure mode segmented folds risk.
